# PCA Visualization Analysis

Here's our PCA visualization showing the relationships between different items:

<PCAVisualization dataPath='/data/circular-features/gemma-2-2b_weekday_very_merged.json'/>

Here's another PCA visualization showing the relationships between different items, but with Gemma 2 9B instead:

<PCAVisualization dataPath='/data/circular-features/gemma-2-9b_weekday_very_merged.json'/>

And here's the one with Gemma 2 27B:

<PCAVisualization dataPath='/data/circular-features/gemma-2-27b_weekday_very_merged.json'/>

## Analysis

The visualization above shows several interesting clusters...
